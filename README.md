AZURO Creator
AI that discovers scientific laws from data — not just predictions

AZURO Creator is an AI system for automatic discovery of interpretable mathematical and physical relationships directly from data.

Instead of producing black-box predictions, AZURO generates human-readable equations that describe the underlying system behavior.

Data → Hypotheses → Mathematical Law

This project explores the direction of AI-assisted scientific law discovery using a hybrid data-driven and symbolic approach.

🧠 What Makes AZURO Different
Traditional ML	AZURO Creator
Black-box predictions	Explicit mathematical laws
Neural weights	Interpretable equations
Hard to explain	Human-readable structure
Pure curve fitting	Structure-oriented discovery

AZURO focuses on extracting structural knowledge, not just prediction accuracy.

🔬 System Capability (Validated)

AZURO has been tested across multiple domains involving different types of mathematical behavior.

📊 Discovery Performance Summary
Domain	Type of Law	Accuracy (R²)	Observed Behavior
Physics	Energy relationships	>99%	Correct recovery of governing structure
Chemistry	Kinetic/exponential behavior	>99%	Accurate structural approximation
Biology	Growth / logistic dynamics	>99%	Nonlinear biological behavior captured
Economics	Production-type relationships	>96%	Complex nonlinear dependency recovered
Finance	Analytical pricing structures	~90%	Partial structural approximation
Neural systems	Mixed nonlinear activations	~72%	Simplified structural representation

Average performance across domains: ~87–90% R²

The system demonstrates robustness under noisy and nonlinear data conditions.

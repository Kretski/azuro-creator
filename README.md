🚀 AZURO Creator
AI that discovers physical & mathematical laws from your data — not just predictions

AZURO Creator is a local AI tool that automatically extracts interpretable equations from input-output datasets (CSV).
Instead of training black-box models, it generates human-readable mathematical hypotheses, evaluates their accuracy (R²), and suggests real-world insights.

Upload data → get the formula.

🧠 What Makes It Different

Most ML tools give you predictions.
AZURO gives you the law behind the data.

Typical ML	AZURO Creator
Black-box models	Clear mathematical equations
Requires cloud/GPU	Fully offline & local
Hard to interpret	Human-readable formulas
Focus on accuracy	Accuracy + understanding
✨ Main Advantages

🖥 100% Local & Offline – no cloud, no internet, no API keys
